                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>Quality Filter Wholesale began on eBay in 2001 by 2 professional firefighters.</p>

                <p>It all started when we (the two owners) were tired of paying high inflated prices for Diesel filters for our trucks. We took it upon ourselves to search out good quality filters that don’t break your wallet to buy. 
                After locating the filters we found a way to buy bulk quantities that would allow us to turn around and resell them at considerably lower prices.</p>
                <p>Our business is run out of Boise, Idaho and Haines, Oregon</p>

            <p>We have sold thousands of filters on eBay and through our website and have had nothing but praise from our customers. We have spent a year putting our new website together and are very excited to bring our 
                Diesel and Heavy Duty filter company to the forefront of the automotive industry.</p>
            <p>We are a small business with very low overhead and only to 2 employees so we can continue to keep our prices affordable.</p>
            <p>We have become a very high volume business with the many return customers and automotive businesses that continue to purchase our products. I won’t lie. This is not our sole source of income. 
                Like many people we work 2 and 3 jobs to make ends meet.</p>
            <p>We understand all too well what it is like to try to keep your vehicles in good running condition and still be able to take care of your family. We will do what it takes to get your business and to get you to come back.</p>
            <p>We also appreciate any “word of mouth” advertising our customers do for us. Please be sure to tell your family, friends, neighbors and fellow workers about us.</p>
            <p>Thank you.</p>
